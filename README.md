Volume of solution must not exceed 100ml, budget to build a machine should not exceed Rs. 4000 and it should at least work for 3 hours continuously and can do one titration at a time. 

## 1.4 Identifying Functions
|Sl. No|Objective|
|:---:|:---:|
|1|Should shake the beaker by itself|
|2|It should have an indicator which indicates after completion of every titration|
|3|Should hold and release beaker|
|4|Machine should be able to release the titrant|

**Problem definition version 1.3:** > Design a semi-automatic titration machine which is able to do accurate acid-base titration. The machine should be portable and user-friendly and fitted with a burette. Machine should do one titration at a time and able to work for at least 3 hours continuously. The volume of the solution must not exceed 100ml in beaker. Machine should be within a budget of Rs.4000. The machine should be able to release the titrant and shake the flask by itself. At last, the machine should be able to alert the user once the endpoint is reached.
